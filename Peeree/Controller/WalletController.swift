*	The WalletController maintains the bought pin points of the user and, in future releases, the already bought premium features, as well as enabling them on the user's demand.
*	It also is informed by the in-app purchase server, when a new purchase was done.
*	And finally, every local action, that reduces the amount of the bought pin points, including transfering them to a remote p2p device with the same Apple ID, has to be requested and granted through this class.
